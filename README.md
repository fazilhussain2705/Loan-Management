 ## 💼 LOAN MANAGEMENT SYSYEM

This is a Loan Management System (LMS) project developed using MySQL, aimed at simplifying and automating the loan processing workflow. It handles borrower data, loan applications, approvals, repayments, and loan status reports — all while ensuring data accuracy and integrity using SQL tools like procedures, triggers, and transactions.

## 🧰 TECHNOLOGIES & TOOLS USED 

- MySQL – RDBMS used for data storage and management

- SQL – For queries, triggers, procedures, and transactions

- Stored Procedures – Automate approval and financial calculations

- Triggers – Enforce rules before and after insert/update operations

- ER Diagram – For visualizing the data structure and relationships
## 🔑 KEY FEATURES

✅ SQL Components and Statements are Used:

- DDL (Data Definition Language) – CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE

- DML (Data Manipulation Language) – INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

- DCL (Data Control Language) – GRANT, REVOKE

- DQL (Data Query Language) – SELECT

- TCL (Transaction Control Language) – COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT
## 📊 DATASET OVERVIEW

📁 The dataset includes:

- Customer Information (Name, Age, Gender)

- Income Data (Slabs for interest calculation)

- Loan Status (Approved, Rejected, Processing)

- Geographical Info (Region, State, Country)

- Credit Metrics (CIBIL score, loan amount
## 🧩 ER DIAGRAM (ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM)

The ER diagram maps the relationship between:

- Customers

- Loan Applications

- Loan Status

- Financial Transactions

This helps visualize data dependencies and enforces integrity using foreign keys.
## ⚡ EXAMPLE FUNCTIONAL WORKFLOWS

- Income & Area-Based Loan Classification:
  Using SQL logic to classify and assign rates dynamically.

- Trigger on Loan Status:
  Automatically changes status upon insert depending on CIBIL   score.

- Procedural Outputs:
  Batch run procedures to fetch updated data, interest calculations, and transaction summaries.
## 📈 OUTCOME

The project demonstrates a scalable and secure way to manage loan data in a banking environment. It improves:

- Data accuracy

- Manual process reduction

- Decision-making via structured reports
## 🏁 CONCLUSION

This project showcases how SQL can be used to build a real-world Loan Management System with efficient data handling, rule enforcement, and automated procedures.
